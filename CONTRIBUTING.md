   git clone https://github.com/briankwest/imglink.git
   cd imglink
   ```

2. Start the development environment:

### Running Tests

#### Backend Tests
```bash

```

#### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

Example:
```python
from typing import Optional, List

def process_image(
    file_path: str,
    width: Optional[int] = None,
    height: Optional[int] = None
) -> dict:
    """
    Process an uploaded image file.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the image file
        width: Target width in pixels
        height: Target height in pixels
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processed image metadata
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful prop names

Example:
```typescript
interface ImageCardProps {
  image: Image;
  onDelete?: (id: number) => void;
  showActions?: boolean;
}

export function ImageCard({ 
  image, 
  onDelete, 
  showActions = true 
}: ImageCardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or modifications
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat: add bulk image upload functionality
fix: resolve memory leak in image processing
docs: update API documentation for albums endpoint
refactor: simplify authentication middleware
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external services (S3, email, etc.)
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Frontend Testing

- Write component tests using React Testing Library
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Mock API calls
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document new API endpoints in docs/API.md
- Add JSDoc/docstrings for new functions
- Update environment variable documentation
- Include examples for complex features
